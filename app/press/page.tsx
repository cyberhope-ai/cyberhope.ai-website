                <strong>Decolores Holdings, LLC dba CyberHope</strong> today announced the closing of its 
                Pre-Seed A Round of equity funding from the Joan C. Young Revocable Trust to advance CyberHope, 
                the flagship workforce and education platform built on the Precognition OS framework.
              </p>

              <p>
                Precognition OS is a universal foresight system that unites human intuition, AI, and machine 
                data into predictive pathways. CyberHope is its first vertical — focused on SkillDNA™, a new 
                model for verifying and aligning real skills with real opportunities across industries.
              </p>

              <p>
                CyberHope was created in a grassroots, real-world lab beginning in 2018, when its founders 
                recognized the needs of underrepresented and diverse communities and saw how traditional 
                credentials were failing them. Partnering with Hope Training Academy (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit), 
                the team delivered hands-on, tech-enabled training that led to the design of a system built 
                around the real needs of real populations. HTA's Onramp to Tech Prosperity initiative has 
                since served thousands of Indiana learners through U.S. Department of Labor–registered 
                apprenticeships in IT and Cybersecurity and industry-recognized certifications as a CompTIA partner.

                  "CyberHope is where human ability meets AI foresight," said Richard M. Barretto, Founder 
                  and Manager of Decolores Holdings, LLC. "As part of Precognition OS, it proves what people 
                  can actually do and connects them with the opportunities they deserve."

              <p>
                CyberHope is designed and optimized across the NVIDIA, Google Cloud, and AWS technology stacks, 
                spanning Edge AI deployments to enterprise-scale environments. Its architecture is also engineered 
                to scale into hyperscale AI data centers and is being built with a long-term vision for quantum 
                computing readiness.
              </p>

              <p>
                This early round marks the first step in CyberHope's growth plan under Precognition OS, with 
                future investment rounds expected as the platform scales pilots and partnerships across industries.
